# cart-pole_deep-RL
Here is a walkthrough of a deep reinforcement learning agent that balances a cart on a pole. See the python notebook for the whole thing. 

# Models
I trained 2 models with different architectures. The v1 is simpler and does an okay job, but the v2 will keep the pole up past Armageddon, not unlike the world famous Johnny. You can run each of them using the associated python scripts. The requirements.txt is an all encompassing library list, but just for running the renders for v1 and v2, all you really need is pytorch, numpy, os, time, and pygame. Happy reinforcing!
